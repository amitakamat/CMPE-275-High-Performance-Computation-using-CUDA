# CMPE 275 High Performance Computation In Image Processing using CUDA
  
## Deep dive into High Performance Computation using CUDA in Image Processing algorithms.  
  
### Image Processing Algorithms:  
1. Blur  
2. Mirror  
  
### Steps followed:  
1. Setup environment for CUDA development.  
2. Implement Mirror and blur image processing algorithms in serial and in parallel using CUDA kernel code.  
3. Calculate time taken for processing images.  
4. Test the performance of parallel code over serial code for different parameters - Blur amount, different input size.  
  
### Tools and Technologies:  
C++, Visual Studio 2017, NSight, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, CUDA development tools
